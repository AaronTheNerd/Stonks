# UI

After reading through (Comparison of UI systems in Unity)[https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.2/Documentation/Manual/UI-system-compare.html]. I have decided that UI Toolkit is the way to go. It has a workflow similar to WebDev and global styling.

# Features

- Two main buttons: one to pump stock, one to dump stock
- Ability to purchase and sell a variety of stocks. Will need to spend more time coming up with joke stock names and their pricing.
  - Nvidio(NVDO) - Nvidia
  - Goggle(GOGG) - Google
  - NikolaX(NIKX) - Tesla
  - Pear(PEAR) - Apple
- Search functionality
- News feed shares information about stocks/industries
- Events constituting minor to large jumps or drops. These can affect individual company, a few companies, or an entire industry. Should probably start fairly normal (i.e. lower earnings than expected, CEO ousted, etc.) then become more extreme (i.e. Portal to hell in office, CEO ascends to the sky, etc.)
  - Redditors conspiring to increase a stocks value
  - The big short
